# -Traffic-Surveillance-System
This Traffic Surveillance system detects the vehicles and track them. It also tells the number of vehicles present in the frame and number of vehicles present in each lane. Also which car is crossing speed limit.                              
In This project object detection is done by two methods one by background sepration and other by using YOLOv4.


Task: Process any open source/Licence free traffic video from web to show following analysis.

Display on frame:
1. Detect: Bounding box on vehicles 
2. Tracking: trailing tail on each box

Real-time stats
1. Number of vehicles in frame.
2. Moving vehicles in frame
3. stopped vehicles in frame
4. Current density of vehicles on different lanes

Summary:
1. Average vehicles passing the junction
2. Average stop time
3. Average density of vehicles on forward lane and Backward lane 
density = Average Number of vehicles on lane/sec
4. Peak time
